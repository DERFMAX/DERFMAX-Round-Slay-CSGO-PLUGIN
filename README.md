## About The Project


This plugin makes it easy for you to kill a player as many times as you want without the need to be using the command all the rounds that you want to kill him, this idea came to me when I was tired of slay all the time on my server and since I did not find anything similar, I decided to do it.

### Installation

1. Download the latest version.
2. Put deletemap.smx in the directory /addons/sourcemod/plugins/
3. Restart the server/change the current map.


### Usage

- To put a slay: !rslay <target> <round(s)>
  
- To quit a slay: !cancelrslay <target>
